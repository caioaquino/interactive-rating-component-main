# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


## The solution

The solution i used is based on pure html, css and javascript, aiming to improve my basic front-end skills. 

The index.html page contains the first screen of the challenge, where the user should select a rating.
The than-you.html page contains the second screen of the challenge, showing a message to thank the user for their rating.

Both pages are responsive for smaller devices and the form is navigable through screen readers and keyboard.

The styling is split into three files: the main.css defines the basic styles, font-sizes and colors. The rating.css defines the styles for the first page. The thank-you.css defines the styles for the second page.
